To use the NavTalk Real-time Digital Human API, you need to register for an account and obtain your API key.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create an Account">
  Visit the [NavTalk Dashboard](https://console.navtalk.ai/#/projects) and sign up for a new account or log in with your existing credentials. Complete the registration process to get started.
</Step>

<Step title="Obtain Your API Key">
  Once logged in to your dashboard, navigate to the [Projects](https://console.navtalk.ai/#/projects) section. Generate a new API key or use your existing key, then copy and securely store your API key.

  <Warning>
    Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories. Use environment variables or secure storage for production applications.
  </Warning>
