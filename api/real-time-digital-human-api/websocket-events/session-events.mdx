Session events manage the connection lifecycle and session state. These events are essential for establishing and maintaining your WebSocket connection.

## Event Types

### `session.created`
Triggered when the WebSocket connection is established and a session is created.

**When to handle**: Send your session configuration immediately after receiving this event.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
case "session.created":
  console.log("Session created, sending session update.");
  await sendSessionUpdate();
  break;
```

```python Python
if data.get('type') == 'session.created':
    print("Session created, sending session update.")
    await send_session_update()
```
</CodeGroup>

**Next step**: Send `session.update` message to configure the session.

### `session.updated`
Triggered after your session configuration is accepted and the session is ready.

**When to handle**: Start sending audio data after receiving this event.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
case "session.updated":
  console.log("Session updated. Ready to receive audio.");
  startRecording();
  break;
```

```python Python
if data.get('type') == 'session.updated':
    print("Session updated. Ready to receive audio.")
    start_recording()
```
</CodeGroup>

**What to do**: Begin capturing and sending user audio input.

## Event Flow

```
Connect WebSocket
  ↓
Receive session.created
  ↓
Send session.update
  ↓
Receive session.updated
  ↓
Start recording and sending audio
```

<Tip>
Always wait for `session.updated` before sending audio data. The session must be fully configured and ready before accepting audio input.
