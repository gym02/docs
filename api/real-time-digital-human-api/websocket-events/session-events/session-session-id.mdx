title: "session.session_id"
description: "Proxy session identifier that transparency-mode and WebRTC signaling rely on"
---

Triggered immediately after the WebSocket handshake completes. The server sends `session.session_id` before `session.created`, and the payload contains the proxy session ID you must reuse for signaling.

## Event Properties

<ResponseField name="type" type="string">
Always `"session.session_id"`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="session_id" type="string">
The proxy session ID. Capture this value and use it as the `userId` when opening the WebRTC signaling socket. When sending `{ type: "create", targetSessionId: ... }`, set `targetSessionId = "target-" + session_id` so the video channel binds to the same session referenced by the WebSocket.
</ResponseField>

<Note>
In transparency mode (`model=transparency`) this is the only event you receive (apart from control events such as `input_audio_buffer.append`). No `response.*` events are emitted.
