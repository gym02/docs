```javascript JavaScript
const websocketUrl = 'wss://transfer.navtalk.ai/api/realtime-api';
const license = 'your-license-key';
const characterName = 'navtalk.Chloe';

const websocketUrlWithParams = `${websocketUrl}?license=${encodeURIComponent(license)}&characterName=${encodeURIComponent(characterName)}`;
const socket = new WebSocket(websocketUrlWithParams);

// Configure Chloe as an educational tutor
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  if (typeof event.data === 'string') {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
