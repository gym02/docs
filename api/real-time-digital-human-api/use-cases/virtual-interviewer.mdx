```javascript JavaScript
const websocketUrl = 'wss://transfer.navtalk.ai/api/realtime-api';
const license = 'your-license-key';
const characterName = 'navtalk.Ava';

const websocketUrlWithParams = `${websocketUrl}?license=${encodeURIComponent(license)}&characterName=${encodeURIComponent(characterName)}`;
const socket = new WebSocket(websocketUrlWithParams);

// Configure Ava as a professional interviewer
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  if (typeof event.data === 'string') {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    
    if (data.type === 'session.created') {
      const sessionConfig = {
        type: 'session.update',
        session: {
          instructions: `
            You are a professional HR interviewer named Ava.
            Your role is to conduct job interviews in a friendly yet professional manner.
            Ask relevant questions about the candidate's experience, skills, and qualifications.
            Assess their responses and provide constructive feedback when appropriate.
            Keep the conversation structured and focused on evaluating the candidate's suitability for the position.
