## How It Works

The Real-time Digital Human API uses a **direct audio-to-audio processing pipeline** that eliminates traditional text conversion steps (STT and TTS), delivering unprecedented speed and natural conversation flow.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Audio Input" icon="microphone">
    Your application captures user audio input and sends audio streams through WebSocket connections. This layer handles real-time audio streaming and ensures continuous bidirectional communication for seamless dialogue.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Direct Processing" icon="bolt">
    GPT-realtime processes audio signals directly without text conversion steps. By eliminating Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) transformations, the system achieves sub-500ms latency and enables natural interruption handling.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Audio Output" icon="volume-high">
    The processed audio response is generated in real-time and synchronized with video rendering. This layer delivers high-quality audio output with preserved fidelity, maintaining natural voice tone and emotional nuances.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Visual Rendering" icon="video">
    Frame-accurate lip sync and emotion-driven facial expressions are rendered in real-time, creating a lifelike visual presence synchronized with the audio output.
