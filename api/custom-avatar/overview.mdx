NavTalk allows you to create and train custom digital human avatars beyond the built-in characters. This enables you to build unique digital personas that match your brand identity, specific use cases, or cultural requirements.

## What is Avatar Training?

Avatar training is the process of creating a custom digital human character by providing training videos and training the system to generate a personalized avatar that can be used in real-time or non-real-time digital human applications.
