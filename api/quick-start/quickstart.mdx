## What is NavTalk?

**NavTalk is a revolutionary real-time virtual digital human construction platform** that integrates the latest cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies. It provides developers with an end-to-end complete solution and significantly lowers the barriers to developing high-quality digital humans, truly realizing an intelligent human-machine interaction experience that is **"what you see is what you get."**

By deeply integrating three core modulesâ€”**computer vision, voice interaction, and intelligent decision-making systems**â€”NavTalk creates digital entities with **highly human-like expressive capabilities**. Our platform equips digital humans with the ability to handle complex conversations, make dynamic decisions, and deliver real-time multimodal outputs.
